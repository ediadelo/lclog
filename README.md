#### logging utility for javascript

Avoid painfull repetition like :

100. a=23
101. console.log("a=" + String(a));

Will print on the console: <br>
your_file.js:101 : a=23


i wrote  the equivalent for Java, C++ and python in some other repos of mine


- clone / download in the source directory
- in the html : <script src=lclog.js />
